HANGMAN

This is an interactive Hangman game created by Jesse and Zoey at the Flatiron School. 

-------------

Synopsis

This is a classic Hangman game that has been created for educational and entertainment purposes as a project for Ruby. The instructions will be given at the start of the game. The basic premise is to guess the hidden word before the game is over. If the player picks a letter that is not a part of the hidden word, then a person will get one step closer to being hanged and the player will have one fewer chances to winning. Conversely, if the player picks a letter that is a part of the word, then both the player and the person will be safe for that turn. 

-------------

Motivation

The Hangman game was created to demonstrate our understanding in Ruby. A combination of class methods and instance variables was mainly used throughout.

-------------

Installation

To play the game, install Ruby(?) and open up Terminal in Mac OS X. Enter into the directory of the Hangman game and run it by entering this command: <ruby bin/run.rb>, or <ruby run.rb> if you are inside the bin folder. Check by entering <pwd> to see where you are located.
